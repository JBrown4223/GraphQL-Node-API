# GraphQL-Node-API
My first API using GraphQL and Apollo

I was given a task to build an app that could display the sales metrics for each server and sections of the restuarant.

Using Node, GraphQL, Apollo, and React I was able to build a simple site that would allow users to view the
metrics for all Servers and Bartenders, as well as view the metrics by section.
